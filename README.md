Well, this is the home of BetSure. :)

The master repo is basically a "nightly" and I'll push updates to this frequently. Whenever I get to a code freeze, I'll create an alpha/beta/live repo as per environments.

Note When connecting to betting exchanges, you'll need a passwd file. That isn't included in the git repo pushes for pretty obvious reasons.

More documentation to follow at a later date.
